## 🤔 Who am I?

My name is Carter Nosek and I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in **Computer Science** at the **University of Florida**. My main areas of interest are **Machine Learning** and **AI** and I plan to specialize my knowledge in those fields as a further my education.

## 🎮 What are some of my hobbies?
Outside of class, I always love learning new ways to make projects that I am interested in. Currently, I am working on improving my **Frontend Development** skills by learning *JS*, *HTML*, and *CSS*. Outside of coding, my second passion is **philosophy**. I love studying the delicate interactions between us and the world and philosophy provides a really useful lens to observe those interactions. I also love cooking/eating, and I am also a big fan of sports, primarily 🏈, ⚽, and 🏀.

## 📃 Language Experience
- C++ (intermediate)
